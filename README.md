## Abstracts
Multi vendor network management and automation is one of the most critical and challenging tasks existing in modern networks. This repository provides overview and examples, how the multi vendor automation can be achieved with two separate frameworks:
- NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support)
- OpenConfig YANG modules over NETCONF transport

## Supported Vendors
